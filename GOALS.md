# What I want to do with this

I want to create a budget manager that can be used to track income, costs, and spending trends. 

### As a user, I want to be able to
1. Add my income to the manager
2. Add any purchases I maker
3. See my shopping trends for each shop(amazon,etc.).
4. Add an item I want to buy, see how much I should save each month
5. (Maybe) Use an API to track payments made using apple pay or google pay
